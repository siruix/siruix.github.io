Generic Receive Offload (GRO) is a mechanism to save CPU by conbining multiple small packets into bigger ones. There is a good [page](https://lwn.net/Articles/358910/) introducing the basic concept and reason behind GRO by J. Corbet. Another [link](https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/queueing-linux-network-stack) on this topic by D. Siemon. In this post, I would provide a deeper code walk to help people understand how GRO code can realize the benefits.
