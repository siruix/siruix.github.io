I did lots of linux kernel modification inside rmnet driver. One of the most important and fundamental knowledge for linux driver development is to have full understanding of how linux kernel manages network packets. [This](https://people.cs.clemson.edu/~westall/853/notes/skbuff.pdf) is a very good sk_buffs introduction tutorial.

Basically, skbuffs are dynamically allocated memory structure where kernel places network packets. There are tons of members inside struct sk_buff, and equally amount of API function to access them. Going through each of them is beyound the scope of this blog. I will hightlight a few most important and often used ones when modifying network drivers. 

### Skbuff Data Structure
Skbuff header (struct sk_buff) itself contains all the meta information, which kernel uses to chain all skbuffs together. It is dynamically allocated from a memory pool. 
{% highlight c %}
skb = kmem_cache_alloc(skbuff_head_cache, gfp_mask);
{% endhighlight %}

Skb header does not contain the payload data. The payload data resides in a dynamic allocated chuck of memory (often called linear buffer/linear data area). Skb header uses head pointer to reference to this linear buffer.  
{% highlight c %}
struct sk_buff {
unsigned char *head,
              *data,
              *tail,
              *end;
}
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight c %}
head = kmalloc(size + sizeof(struct skb_shared_info), gfp_mask);
{% endhighlight %}

Notice that besides the "size", there is a mandatory chunk of memory for "struct skb_shared_info" that immediately follows. 

```c
struct skb_shared_info {
	struct sk_buff	*frag_list;
	skb_frag_t	frags[MAX_SKB_FRAGS];
};
```

When the linear buffer is not large enough to hold the payload data, those data can be placed in a page, and be referenced by frags[]. Given 4KB each page, and frags[16], the total paged buffer can hold up to 64KB of data. Such paged memory design could save huge amount of memory copy when the payload data is moved across the network stack. Furthermore, when payload data is bigger than 64KB, more skbuff can be linked together using the frag_list pointer. 

### How Skbuff APIs Manage Payload Data?
[This](http://vger.kernel.org/~davem/skb_data.html) blog provides a good illustration on the basic skbuff APIs that manipulate payload data. 

![skb_linear_buffer]({{ "/assets/skb_layout.png" | absolute_url }})

**head** always points to the beginning of linear buffer. **end** always points to the end of linear buffer. **data** points to the beginning of payload data. **tail** points to the end of payload data. The **data** and **tail** are designed to be easily be moved up and down. Since network procesing involves lots of inserting and stripping headers and trailers, having the linear data freely extending and shrinking in size saves data copies.
