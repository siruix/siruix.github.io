I did lots of linux kernel modification inside rmnet driver. One of the most important and fundamental knowledge for linux driver development is to have full understanding of how linux kernel manages network packets. This is a very good sk_buffs introduction tutorial https://people.cs.clemson.edu/~westall/853/notes/skbuff.pdf

Basically, skbuffs are dynamically allocated memory structure where kernel places network packets. There are tons of members inside struct sk_buff, and equally amount of API function to access them. Going through each of them is beyound the scope of this blog. I will hightlight a few most important and often used ones when modifying network drivers.
