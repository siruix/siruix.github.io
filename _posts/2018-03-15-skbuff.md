I did lots of linux kernel modification inside rmnet driver. One of the most important and fundamental knowledge for linux driver development is to have full understanding of how linux kernel manages network packets. [This](https://people.cs.clemson.edu/~westall/853/notes/skbuff.pdf) is a very good sk_buffs introduction tutorial.

Basically, skbuffs are dynamically allocated memory structure where kernel places network packets. There are tons of members inside struct sk_buff, and equally amount of API function to access them. Going through each of them is beyound the scope of this blog. I will hightlight a few most important and often used ones when modifying network drivers. 

### Skbuff Data Structure
Skbuff header (struct sk_buff) itself contains all the meta information, which kernel uses to chain all skbuffs together. It is dynamically allocated from a memory pool. 

```c
skb = kmem_cache_alloc(skbuff_head_cache, gfp_mask);
```

Skb header does not contain the payload data. The payload data resides in a dynamic allocated chuck of memory (often called linear buffer/linear data area). Skb header uses head pointer to reference to this linear buffer.  

```c
struct sk_buff {
unsigned char *head,
              *data,
              *tail,
              *end;
}
```

```c
head = kmalloc(size + sizeof(struct skb_shared_info), gfp_mask);
```

Notice that besides the "size", there is a mandatory chunk of memory for "struct skb_shared_info" that immediately follows. 

```c
struct skb_shared_info {
	struct sk_buff	*frag_list;
	skb_frag_t	frags[MAX_SKB_FRAGS];
};
```

When the linear buffer is not large enough to hold the payload data, those data can be placed in a page, and be referenced by frags[]. Given 4KB each page, and frags[16], the total paged buffer can hold up to 64KB of data. Such paged memory design could save huge amount of memory copy when the payload data is moved across the network stack. Furthermore, when payload data is bigger than 64KB, more skbuff can be linked together using the frag_list pointer. 

### How Skbuff APIs Manage Payload Data?
[This](http://vger.kernel.org/~davem/skb_data.html) blog provides a good illustration on the basic skbuff APIs that manipulate payload data. 

![skb_linear_buffer]({{ "/assets/skb_layout.png" | absolute_url }})

**head** always points to the beginning of linear buffer. **end** always points to the end of linear buffer. **data** points to the beginning of payload data. **tail** points to the end of payload data. The **data** and **tail** are designed to be easily be moved up and down. Since network procesing involves lots of inserting and stripping headers and trailers, having the linear data freely extending and shrinking in size saves data copies. 

```c
static inline void skb_reserve(struct sk_buff *skb, unsigned int len)
{
  skb->data += len;
  skb->tail += len;
}
```
This function adjusts the skbuff headroom. It is usually called after the skb allocation. 

```c
static inline unsigned char *skb_push(struct sk_buff *skb, unsigned int len)
{
  skb->data -= len;
  skb->len += len;
  if (unlikely(skb->data < skb->head))
    skb_under_panic(skb, len, current_text_addr());
  return skb->data;
}
```
This function is usually called to prepare the space where to prepend protocol headers. 


```c
static inline unsigned char *skb_pull(struct sk_buff *skb, unsigned int len)
{
  return (len > skb->len) ? NULL : __skb_pull(skb, len);
}
static inline char *__skb_pull(struct sk_buff *skb, unsigned int len)
{
  skb->len -= len;
  BUG_ON(skb->len < skb->data_len);
  return skb->data += len;
}
```
This function extends the used data area of the buffer at the buffer start. 

```c
static inline void skb_trim(struct sk_buff *skb, unsigned int len)
{
  if (skb->len > len)
    __skb_trim(skb, len);
}
static inline void __skb_trim(struct sk_buff *skb, unsigned int len)
{
  if (!skb->data_len) {
    skb->len = len;
    skb->tail = skb->data + len;
  } else
    ___pskb_trim(skb, len, 0);
}
```
If the skbuff is linear, simply sets the total data length to **len** and trims the **skb->tail**
pointer. Otherwise if the skbuff is nonlinear it calls the _____pskb_trim()__ function.
___pskb_trim()__ is to trim non-linear skb. 

```c
static inline void kfree_skb(struct sk_buff *skb)
{
  if (atomic_read(&skb->users) == 1 || atomic_dec_and_test(&skb->users))
    __kfree_skb(skb);
}
```

For a detail list of APIs, please refer to [this]({{ "/assets/skb_apis.pdf" | absolute_url }}) document. 


### How Skb Handle Large Data
When the amount of payload data exceeds the **size** of linear data buffer. One might re-alloc a larger skb, and copy the old data before appending new data. These alloc-copy process is quite heavy. Moreover, the size is limited to the kernel page size. Skb uses the **frag_list** to point to another skb, and they togegher form a bigger one logically. 

The **frag[]** fields provide yet another method to organise multiple skbs together. **frag[]** contains pointers that reference to page.  

### An Example to use Page Data to improve Efficiency
During the network processing, data are moved from one layer to another. Such data movement may involve copying payload data from one skb to another. To improve the efficiency, one may try to get rid of data copying at all. One way is to use skb_clone() API, which will allocate only the skb header, and not allocate the linear buffer. Another method is to use **frag[]** to reference to the page where the old skb data reside in. Either way no data copy will be involved.
